## Description
Solution from Leaders of Digital 2021 hackathon.  
Track - Healthcare, EPAM task.

### Task
Develop a model for detecting spikes on electrograms after COVID-2019.  
Comparison metric - **binary accuracy**.

## Solution
Tested two models: 1D-convolutional neural network (CNN) and XGBoost classifier.  
CNN showed higher accuracy - **0.913**.  
Spike detection metrics:
- Precision - 0.77  
- Recall - 0.27
